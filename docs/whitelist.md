title: Root Server IP Whitelist
description: List of ZeroTier infrastructure endpoints
---

For minimal operation, outbound UDP on port 9993 (and reply packets) should be allowed to ZeroTier's root servers. Allowing other UDP is ideal since it allows peer to peer connectivity, but these IPs on 9993 are the minimal requirement for ZeroTier to work:

```sh
root-lax-01.zerotier.com has address 104.194.8.134
root-lax-01.zerotier.com has IPv6 address 2605:9880:200:1200:30:571:e34:51
root-mia-01.zerotier.com has address 103.195.103.66
root-mia-01.zerotier.com has IPv6 address 2605:9880:400:c3:254:f2bc:a1f7:19
root-sgp-01.zerotier.com has address 50.7.252.138
root-sgp-01.zerotier.com has IPv6 address 2001:49f0:d0db:2::2
root-zrh-01.zerotier.com has address 84.17.53.155
root-zrh-01.zerotier.com has IPv6 address 2a02:6ea0:d405::9993
root-alice-sfo-01.zerotier.com has address 107.170.197.14
root-alice-sfo-01.zerotier.com has IPv6 address 2604:a880:1:20::200:e001
```

These are Amsterdam, Seattle, Miami, and Singapore. SFO still exists to point very old nodes to the newer roots.

We've also created a DNS record: `host root.zerotier.com`

:::caution Subject to change
These IPs are subject to change and new root points of presence could be added or removed.
