## How ZeroTier Pricing Works

ZeroTier is available under a variety of subscription plans, from our [Basic](#basic) tier to customer-specific [commercial](#commercial) agreements. Our standard plan ([Essential](#essential)) provides flexible usage-based pricing and bundled features that support most professional use cases.

No matter which plan you choose, ZeroTier pricing is based on the number of devices authorized to access your networks. That means that if the same device is connected to multiple networks, it only counts once.

See our public [pricing page](https://www.zerotier.com/pricing/) for the most up-to-date plans and terms.

## Basic

We offer our Basic (free) tier to anyone who wants to try out ZeroTier to get remote access to a local network, host / join a gaming network, run a small homelab, or evaluate the platform. Our free option allows for a limited number of devices, and is intended for testing, non-commercial, and personal use.

:::note
Downloading and using the ZeroTier client is free. Our paid subscriptions apply to usage of Central, our hosted network administration dashboard.

Once you're ready to use ZeroTier for your business, or need to deploy larger networks, we offer two commercial pricing options: Essential and Commercial.

## Essential

Essential subscriptions offer a pay-as-you-go model to add devices, admins, and SSO seats to your networks as your usage changes. You'll only be charged a flat monthly feed for your subscription, plus a small incremental cost for each authorized device after the free limit. You can upgrade to Essential at any time from the [Account](https://my.zerotier.com/account) page on Central.

For Essential subscribers, we charge per unique device authorized in a given month. That means you pay for the device you use in each billing cycle. De-authorized devices still count in the current month, but will be removed in the following one.

So for example if you begin your billing cycle with 15 authorized devices, then add five (5) more during the month, you'll be charged incrementally for remainder of the month for each device as you add it, then the full monthly charge for 20 at the start of the cycle. If you de-authorize devices, your billed amount will stay the same for the current month, then go down at the start of the next billing cycle.

We also provide a "grace period" on all device authorization to prevent accidental spikes based on runaway automation or very brief testing.

## Commercial

[Commercial](#commercial) plans offers volume discounts for larger deployments, as well as annual pricing and other business-friendly payment options. To enroll in a Commercial plan, just [contact our sales team](https://www.zerotier.com/contact).

As a Commercial subscriber, your precise terms and pricing are part of your contract.
