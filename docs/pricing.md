## How ZeroTier Pricing Works

ZeroTier is available under a variety of subscription plans, from our [Basic](#basic) tier to customer-specific [commercial](#commercial) agreements. Our standard plan ([Essential](#essential)) provides flexible usage-based pricing and bundled features that support most professional use cases. The [Premium](#premium) subscription tier supports our customers with larger IoT or SD-WAN deployments, as well as service providers.

No matter which plan you choose, ZeroTier pricing is based on the number of devices authorized to access your networks. That means that if the same device is connected to multiple networks, it only counts once.

See our public [pricing page](https://www.zerotier.com/pricing/) for the most up-to-date plans and terms.

## Basic

We offer our Basic (free) tier to anyone who wants to try out ZeroTier to get remote access to a local network, host / join a gaming network, run a small homelab, or evaluate the platform. Our free option allows for a limited number of devices, and is intended for testing, non-commercial, and personal use.

:::note
Downloading and using the ZeroTier client is free. Our paid subscriptions apply to usage of Central, our hosted network administration dashboard.

Once you're ready to use ZeroTier for your business, or need to deploy larger networks, we offer two commercial pricing options: Essential and Commercial.

## Essential

Essential subscriptions offer a pay-as-you-go model to add devices, admins, and SSO seats to your networks as your usage changes. You'll only be charged a flat monthly feed for your subscription, plus a small incremental cost for each authorized device after the free limit. You can upgrade to Essential at any time from the [Account](https://my.zerotier.com/account) page on Central.

For Essential subscribers, we charge per unique device authorized in a given month. That means you pay for the device you use in each billing cycle. De-authorized devices still count in the current month, but will be removed in the following one.

So for example if you begin your billing cycle with 15 authorized devices, then add five (5) more during the month, you'll be charged incrementally for remainder of the month for each device as you add it, then the full monthly charge for 20 at the start of the cycle. If you de-authorize devices, your billed amount will stay the same for the current month, then go down at the start of the next billing cycle.

We also provide a "grace period" on all device authorization to prevent accidental spikes based on runaway automation or very brief testing.

## Premium

Premium subscriptions offer discounted pricing for larger deployments, with pricing starting at 125 devices. You can upgrade to Premium at any time to take advantage of bulk discounts and additional business-centric features, as well as priority support.

Billing for Premium works very much like Essential. With your base subscription you can grow and shrink your deployments up to 125 simultaneous devices; after that, progressive discounts apply to successive quantities. See our [pricing page](https://www.zerotier.com/pricing/) for details on tiers, additional features, and support commitments.

### Cost Breakdown

The base subscription for Premium is $250/mo. with the first 125 devices included. After that, the price per device decreases according to the total size of your deployment.

| Device Count | Additional Cost per Device |
| --- | --- |
| 0-125 | Included in subscription |
| 126-250 | $1.85 |
| 251-750 | $1.70 |
| 751-1500 | $1.50 |
| >1500 | Call Sales |

:::note
Example: if you authorize 300 devices on your Premium subscription, you'll pay the base fee (which covers the first 125 devices) plus the incremental fee for your 175 additional devices at $1.85 each, for a total of $573.75 per month.

## Commercial

[Commercial](#commercial) plans offers volume discounts for larger deployments, as well as annual pricing and other business-friendly payment options. To enroll in a Commercial plan, just [contact our sales team](https://www.zerotier.com/contact).

As a Commercial subscriber, your precise terms and pricing are part of your contract.
