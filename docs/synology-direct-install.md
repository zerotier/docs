# Installing ZeroTier Directly on Synology NAS (Including ARM64 Models)

## Overview

This guide describes how to install ZeroTier directly on Synology NAS devices without using Docker. This method is particularly valuable for ARM64-based Synology models where Docker (Container Manager) cannot be installed, or where you prefer to avoid Docker dependencies altogether.

## Advantages Over Physical Network Integration

Unlike the physical network integration approach, this method:

- Runs ZeroTier directly on the NAS device itself
- Eliminates the need for an intermediary Linux device
- Provides more direct and potentially faster connectivity
- Simplifies the overall network architecture
- Uses the latest ZeroTier client version

## Supported Devices

This approach works on both x86_64 and ARM64-based Synology NAS models, including:
- RS819, DS119j, DS418, DS418j
- DS218, DS218play, DS118
- And most other Synology NAS models

## Prerequisites

- SSH access to your Synology NAS
- Administrator credentials
- Basic command line knowledge
- Access to a Linux system (for compiling ZeroTier)

## Installation Process

### 1. Create a Persistent TUN Interface

First, SSH to your Synology as root and run the following commands:

```bash
ssh user@synology-ip
sudo -i
echo -e '#!/bin/sh -e \ninsmod /lib/modules/tun.ko' > /usr/local/etc/rc.d/tun.sh
chmod a+x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/tun.sh
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/tun.sh
```

Verify the TUN interface was created:
```bash
ls /dev/net/tun
```

The command output should be `/dev/net/tun`.

### 2. Compile ZeroTier With No Dependencies

This approach creates a statically-linked ZeroTier executable that can run on your Synology NAS without any additional dependencies. You'll need to perform these steps on a Linux machine with the same architecture as your NAS (x86_64 or ARM64).

#### Preparation

Install required build tools on your Linux machine:

```bash
sudo apt install curl build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

#### Find the Latest ZeroTier Version

Check the [ZeroTier GitHub releases page](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/releases) for the latest stable version. You can retrieve it programmatically with:

```bash
# Get latest release version
LATEST_ZT_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/releases/latest | grep -Po '"tag_name": "\K[^"]*')
echo "Latest ZeroTier version is: $LATEST_ZT_VERSION"
```

#### Download and Build ZeroTier

```bash
# You can use the retrieved version or specify one manually
# LATEST_ZT_VERSION is used if set, otherwise defaults to a known working version
ZT_VERSION=${LATEST_ZT_VERSION:-1.14.2}
wget https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/archive/refs/tags/$ZT_VERSION.tar.gz
tar zxf $ZT_VERSION.tar.gz
cd ZeroTierOne-*
```

Build a statically-linked executable:

```bash
make -j`nproc` ZT_STATIC=1
strip zerotier-one
```

Create an archive containing the binary and symlink:

```bash
tar -czvf zerotier_$(uname -p)_$ZT_VERSION.tar.gz zerotier-one zerotier-cli
```

#### Transfer to Synology NAS

Transfer the archive to your Synology NAS using SCP or another file transfer method:

```bash
scp zerotier_$(uname -p)_$ZT_VERSION.tar.gz user@synology-ip:/tmp/
```

### 3. Install ZeroTier on Synology

SSH to your Synology NAS and create a directory for ZeroTier:

```bash
ssh user@synology-ip
sudo -i
mkdir -p /volume1/Work/.zerotier
cd /volume1/Work/.zerotier
```

Extract the archive you transferred:

```bash
cp /tmp/zerotier_*.tar.gz .
tar -xzf zerotier_*.tar.gz
rm zerotier_*.tar.gz
```

Create a startup script (zerotier-start.sh):

```bash
cat > zerotier-start.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

# Script to start ZeroTier One as a background service on Synology NAS
ZEROTIER_DIR="$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")"
cd "$ZEROTIER_DIR"

# Create identity secret if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -d "./zerotier-one" ]; then
    mkdir -p "./zerotier-one"
fi

# Start ZeroTier One service
./zerotier-one -d
EOF

chmod +x zerotier-start.sh
```

### 4. Create a DSM Scheduled Task

1. Open DSM and navigate to Control Panel â†’ Task Scheduler
2. Create a "zerotier" triggered task that will execute automatically at boot
3. Configure the task to:
   - Run at Boot-up
   - Execute under root user
   - Point to the full path of zerotier-start.sh (e.g., /volume1/Work/.zerotier/zerotier-start.sh)
   - Optionally, configure task output logging to a specific folder

Run the scheduled task manually to avoid having to reboot now.

### 5. Verify Installation

From your SSH session, check if the ZeroTier service is running:

```bash
sudo ./zerotier-cli status
```

You should see output similar to:
```
200 info 339748e2d0 1.12.2 ONLINE
```

If successful, you can now join the networks you need and authorize them via the ZeroTier Central website:

```bash
sudo ./zerotier-cli join your_network_id
```

## Updating to a New Version

When a new version of ZeroTier is released:

1. **Backup your identity**: Before updating, backup your ZeroTier identity files
   ```bash
   # On your Synology NAS
   sudo -i
   cd /volume1/Work/.zerotier
   cp -r zerotier-one zerotier-one.backup
   ```

2. **Compile the new version**: Follow the "Compile ZeroTier With No Dependencies" steps above with the new version

3. **Replace the binary**: Upload and replace just the binary while preserving your identity folder
   ```bash
   # After transferring the new archive to your NAS
   cd /volume1/Work/.zerotier
   # Stop ZeroTier
   pkill zerotier-one
   # Extract new binary (overwriting the old one)
   tar -xzf /tmp/zerotier_*.tar.gz
   # Restart ZeroTier
   ./zerotier-start.sh
   ```

4. **Verify the update**:
   ```bash
   ./zerotier-cli status
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Service not starting**: Check the log folder for error messages
- **TUN interface missing**: Ensure the tun.sh script runs correctly at startup
- **Permission issues**: Verify all files have the correct execution permissions
- **Network connectivity fails**: Ensure your NAS firewall allows ZeroTier traffic (port 9993 UDP)
- **Compilation errors**: Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed on your build machine
- **Version compatibility issues**: If you encounter problems with a specific version, try using a previous known-good version (e.g., 1.14.2)

## Maintenance and Updates

- This method survives DSM updates
- Always backup your identity before updating ZeroTier
- Monitor the ZeroTier logs periodically for any error messages
- Check the [ZeroTier GitHub releases page](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/releases) periodically for new versions and security updates

## Conclusion

This direct installation method provides a more integrated approach compared to physical network integration, especially for ARM64-based Synology NAS models where Docker isn't an option. The statically-linked ZeroTier client ensures compatibility and allows you to use the latest ZeroTier features without Docker overhead.
