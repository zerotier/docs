SSO Configuration
=====


## ZeroTier Central configuration

:::note

SSO is currently only supported on desktop operating systems such as macOS and Windows. Support for iOS and Android, and better support for authenticating via the command line is still to come.

:::

### Update clients
- Download and install ZeroTier 1.10.0 or greater on clients that will use SSO.

    https://www.zerotier.com/download/
    

### Configure SSO in ZeroTier Central 
Visit https://my.zerotier.com/account and complete the SSO configuration toward the bottom of the page. You will need your sso provider's Isssuer URL as well as a Client ID.

### Configure SSO on individual networks. 
If you enable this on an existing network, you may accidentally block existing users. Please practice on a test network.

### Exclude specific devices from SSO requirements
This is useful for routers, servers, embedded devices, etcâ€¦
You can do this from the wrench icon in the Members list.

## SSO provider configuration

* SSO Provider **must** support [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/)
* Requires the following scopes:
  * `openid`
  * `profile`
  * `email`
  * `offline_access`
* Configure the callback URL to `http://localhost:9993/sso`


## Provider Specific Configuration Notes

### Auth0 
Please ensure the following fields are set on your Auth0 application config:
- Application Type:  Native
- Token Endpoint Authentication Method: None
- Allowed Callback URL: http://localhost:9993/sso
- Under Advanced Settings -> Grant Types, ensure Implicit, Authorization Code, and Refresh Token are selected.

::: note

The OIDC spec is picky about the Issuer URL you enter.  It must match what the server configuration metadata endpoint returns. 

In the case of Auth0 specifically, Your Issuer URL *MUST* end with a `/`.  For example, in Auth0's application configuration, show's just the fully qualified domain name.  What must be entered in the Issuer field in ZeroTier Central is: `https://your-domain-id.auth0.com/`

:::

### Authelia

[Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) is a self hosted SSO solution. ZeroTier uses PKCE, so the field `secret` must be an empty string and `public` must be true.
    
:::note 

Use of Authelia requires ZeroTierOne version 1.10.1 or greater.  There is an incompatibility between the two in the 1.10.0 release.

:::

Example client configuration:

    clients:
        ## The ID is the OpenID Connect ClientID which is used to link an application to a configuration.
      - id: authelia-sso-client

        ## The description to show to users when they end up on the consent screen. Defaults to the ID above.
        description: zerotier

        ## The client secret is a shared secret between Authelia and the consumer of this client.
        secret: ""

        ## Sector Identifiers are occasionally used to generate pairwise subject identifiers. In most cases this is not
        ## necessary. Read the documentation for more information.
        ## The subject identifier must be the host component of a URL, which is a domain name with an optional port.
        # sector_identifier: example.com

        ## Sets the client to public. This should typically not be set, please see the documentation for usage.
        public: true

        ## The policy to require for this client; one_factor or two_factor.
        authorization_policy: one_factor

        ## By default users cannot remember pre-configured consents. Setting this value to a period of time using a
        ## duration notation will enable users to remember consent for this client. The time configured is the amount
        ## of time the pre-configured consent is valid for granting new authorizations to the user.
        # pre_configured_consent_duration:

        ## Audience this client is allowed to request.
        audience: [
          "authelia-test-client"
        ]

        ## Scopes this client is allowed to request.
        scopes:
          - openid
          - groups
          - email
          - profile
          - offline_access

        ## Redirect URI's specifies a list of valid case-sensitive callbacks for this client.
        redirect_uris:
          - http://localhost:9993/sso

        ## Grant Types configures which grants this client can obtain.
        ## It's not recommended to define this unless you know what you're doing.
        grant_types:
          - refresh_token
          - authorization_code

        ## Response Types configures which responses this client can be sent.
        ## It's not recommended to define this unless you know what you're doing.
        response_types:
          - code
          - id_token

        ## Response Modes configures which response modes this client supports.
        response_modes:
          - form_post
          - query
          - fragment

        ## The algorithm used to sign userinfo endpoint responses for this client, either none or RS256.
        userinfo_signing_algorithm: none

### Azure AD

Navigate to your directory in the Azure portal, and select "App Registrations" in the Manage column.

Click "New Registration"

Set the Name of the application. e.g. "ZeroTier Central SSO"

Under Redirect URI:

Platform: Public client/native (mobile & desktop)

Set the Redirect URI to `http://localhost:9993/sso`

### Google Workspace
Google OAuth2/OIDC is not supported as Google does not support PKCE clients at this time. You can, however, use [Keycloak as a SAML Identity Broker](http://localhost:3000/central/sso#keycloak-as-a-saml-identity-broker) with Google Workspace.

### Keycloak 

Log into your Keycloak administration console, go to the Client configuration and create a new client. Configuration is fairly straightforward, with the following requirements:

- Client Protocol: openid-connect
- Access Type: public
- Standard Flow Enabled: ON
- Root URL: https://my.zerotier.com
- Valid Redirect URLS
  - https://my.zerotier.com/*
  - http://localhost/sso
- Admin URL: https://my.zerotier.com
- Web Origins: *

See [here](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#assembly-managing-clients_server_administration_guide) for full documentation for configuring OpenID Connect clients with Keycloak.

#### Keycloak as a SAML Identity Broker

If you have a SAML provider, but not an OpenID Connect provider, [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) can also be used to bridge the gap. On your keycloak Admin page, go to Identity Providers. From the dropdown, select `SAML v2.0` and create the connection to your SAML provider. Combined with the general Keycloak OIDC client settings above, you now have an OIDC server that authenticates against your SAML provider.

### Okta
- Application Type:  Native
- Token Endpoint Authentication Method: None
- Allowed Callback URL: http://localhost:9993/sso
- Under Advanced Settings -> Grant Types, ensure Implicit, Authorization Code, and Refresh Token are selected.

### OneIdentity
OneIdentity may require manual whitelisting of the following scopes: `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `offline_access`.

## Customizing the Final SSO Flow Page

If you wish, you can customize the final view of the sso login process. 
Create the file `$ZEROTIER_HOME/sso-auth.template.html`. 

Note: Any CSS or images must be hosted externally, or placed within the single HTML page itself.

You may customize the page to look however you wish. At this time there
are only two template values set by zerotier:
- `networkId`
- `messageText`

Templates must be valid HTML, and the template values must be placed inside ``{{ ...  }}` blocks like so:

    {{ networkId }}
    {{ messageText }}

You may react to errors via the `isError` variable:

    {% if isError %}
    <span style="color: red;">{{ messageText }}</span>
    {% else %}
    {{ messageText }}
    {% endif %}
