description: Running ZeroTier in a Docker Container
---

Simple example using an interactive shell.

ZeroTier One makes ZeroTier virtual networks available as 'tap' virtual network ports. To do this inside a Docker container requires a few elevated permissions and access to the `/dev/net/tun` device.

Fortunately this is easy:

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
--cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN \
--device=/dev/net/tun centos:7 [... command ...]
```

Where `[... command ...]` is an optional command, in the example below we'll provide `/bin/bash` to get an interactive shell.

You may want to also add ```--volume <volume-name>:/var/lib/zerotier-one``` to preserve container's configuration (such as Node's address) during the image upgrade.

:::info
`SYS_ADMIN` is needed because `NET_ADMIN` does not include the `ioctl()` required to put `/dev/net/tun` in tap mode. This appears to be a bug in Linux's capability model but it would have to be fixed upstream.

Here's a transcript of an example session where we start a command prompt in a test container, install ZeroTier, start it (must be done manually here because the container does not run init or systemd), join a test network, and ping something.

Starting a container with an interactive shell:

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
--cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN \
--device=/dev/net/tun centos:7 /bin/bash
```

Then, while inside the container we install ZeroTier:

```sh
[root@5b88595860bc /]# curl https://install.zerotier.com/ | bash

Start ZeroTier and join a network:

```sh
[root@5b88595860bc /]# /usr/sbin/zerotier-one -d
[root@5b88595860bc /]# /usr/sbin/zerotier-cli join 8056c2e21c000001
200 join OK

Exit

```sh
