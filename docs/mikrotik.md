### Choosing a model

For best performance it is recommended that you choose a model that has a `64-bit ARM` chip (arm64). **Not 32-bit ARM**. 32-bit ARM devices will work but with significantly reduced performance. Currently no `MIPS` ZeroTier package exists for MikroTik devices.

:::note
If you're an enterprise-sized entity looking to integrate MikroTik + ZeroTier we'd recommend getting some guidance from [IP ArchiTechs](https://iparchitechs.com/ecosystem/mikrotik-network-consulting) who are very familiar with the performance characteristics of various models and can help design a solution for you.

### Troubleshooting

Since MikroTik developed and maintains the ZeroTier package themselves you may need to [search](https://forum.mikrotik.com/search.php?keywords=zerotier) or ask questions on [their forum](https://forum.mikrotik.com/) if you need additional help please come visit our forum and we'll try to help.

If you're new to ZeroTier we'd recommend reading our [Getting Started Guide](./start.md).
