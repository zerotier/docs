### Can I move or transfer my network(s) to another user? {#transfer-network}

When you join an [organization](./organizations.md), all of your networks are transferred to the organization. The owner of the organization will become the owner of the networks.

If an account is already in an organization, it cannot join a different one.

There is no way to transfer networks between accounts.

We can't move your networks around from our end via email or support ticket because that is insecure.

If you can't join an organization, create a new network with similar settings, have all your devices join the new network, then have them leave the old network.
