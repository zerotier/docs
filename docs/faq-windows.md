### General Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble using ZeroTier on Windows, the following steps may be of assistance.

#### Instructions

- Make sure you have Administrative Rights on your user.
- Uninstall any other VPN software that could be conflicting with the ZeroTier setup.
- Check for any antivirus software that has additional "Internet Security" features, that could be blocking installation and trying to assume Windows Firewall functionality.
- Try different combinations of rebooting and reinstalling ZeroTier.

Side note: there were reported VPN issues in certain versions of Windows 10; those have their own fix via Microsoft.
