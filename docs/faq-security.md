### Cryptography

ZeroTier uses state of the art cryptographic methods to encrypt your traffic end-to-end. [Read more here](./protocol.md#cryptography)

### Report a vulnerability

If you believe you've found a vulnerability please follow the instructions here to [report it to our team](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/blob/dev/SECURITY.md)

### Audit

In March 2020 we worked with `@trailofbits` to audit our protocol and cryptographic designs for ZeroTier 2.0. As one of its subjects is in our just-released beta, we are ready to make our first preliminary audit public [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/zt-web-large-files/ZeroTier%20Protocol%20Review%20Summary.pdf). A full code audit is coming after 2.0.
