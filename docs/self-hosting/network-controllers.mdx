# Self-Hosting ZeroTier Network Controllers

## Reference Docs

### README
https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/tree/master/controller

### API clients
There is an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) spec at https://docs.zerotier.com/openapi/servicev1.json
which can be used to [generate API clients](https://openapi-generator.tech/) in many languages. 

You can [browse](/service/v1#tag/controller) the docs here.

## Tutorial
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

First, skim the [README](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/tree/master/controller). 

We're going to use `curl` to set up an example ZeroTier network. An easy way to get `curl` in Windows is to install [the latest version of Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which comes with bash, curl, and other tools.

This is a low tech way to setup a controller for example purposes. You'd likely build yourself something fancier around this API.

### Authtoken

The authtoken.secret file in the ZeroTier home directory is required to make API calls to the controller service.

:::note
ZeroTier generates the token at random the first time it starts. You can change it if you want. 
:::

Lets save the token to an environment variable. We need it in all the following commands.

<Tabs
    groupId="operating-systems"
    defaultValue="linux"
    values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

```sh
TOKEN=$(sudo cat /var/lib/zerotier-one/authtoken.secret)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos">

```sh
TOKEN=$(sudo cat "/Library/Application Support/ZeroTier/One/authtoken.secret")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">
    <div>
    The token file is located at:
    </div>
    <code>
    \ProgramData\ZeroTier\One\authtoken.secret
    </code>
    <div>
    But I'm not sure how environment variables work in Windows. Maybe you can use the linux subsystem thing and just follow the linux instructions?

### Get your Node ID
:::note
Network IDs are based on the Node ID of the Controller. Controllers are nodes! When you join a network, your node finds the controller like it does with other nodes: by it's Node ID. 
:::

#### with zerotier-cli

(may need sudo)

    zerotier-cli info


#### with curl

    curl "http://localhost:9993/status" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" 

It's the "Address" in the above's output.

Let's save the Node ID to an environment variable too:

    NODEID=your-node-id

or try:

    NODEID=$(zerotier-cli info | cut -d " " -f 3)

### Create a Network

    curl -X POST "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/${NODEID}______" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" -d {}

This should return JSON for a fresh network. 


:::note
When you post to `/network/${NODEID}______` the controller generates a random Network ID for you.
See the "id" of your newly created network.
:::

Let's save the new Network ID to an environment variable

    NWID=your-network-id


### List Networks

    curl "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" 
    
This returns a list of Network IDs. It should include the ID returned by the create command we did in the previous step.

### Get Network Info

    curl "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/${NWID}/" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" 


### List Network Members

You'll need another node join your network first, or this will be empty.
You can use a phone, or another PC, or a VM, or a VPS...

    curl "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/${NWID}/member" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" 

I guess you could join the controller node to it's own network, for demonstration purposes.

Save the Node ID of one of your Network _Members_ in an env var

    MEMID=a-member's-node-id

### Get Member Info

    curl "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/${NWID}/member/${MEMID}" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" 


### Configure the Network
For Nodes can talk, we need to add a Managed Route and IP Auto-Assign Range on the network.
Let's make it a Private network too. Prefer Private networks.

    curl -X POST "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/${NWID}/" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" \
    -d '{"ipAssignmentPools": [{"ipRangeStart": "192.168.192.1", "ipRangeEnd": "192.168.192.254"}], "routes": [{"target": "192.168.192.0/24", "via": null}], "v4AssignMode": "zt", "private": true }'


### Authorize a member

    curl -X POST "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/${NWID}/member/${MEMID}" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" -d '{"authorized": true}'


### Network Info Again

    curl "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/${NWID}/" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" 


### Member Info Again

    curl "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/${NWID}/member/${MEMID}" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" 
    
### Confirm from your nodes

    sudo zerotier-cli listnetworks
    
It should say "OK PRIVATE" and have an IP address.


### Deauthorize Member

    curl -X POST "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/${NWID}/member/${MEMID}" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}" -d '{"authorized": false}'

### Delete Member

    curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9993/controller/network/${NWID}/member/${MEMID}" -H "X-ZT1-AUTH: ${TOKEN}"

:::caution
You can "delete" a member, but they will show up in the output of "list member" again if the node is still online and trying to join. You should make sure to deauthorize before deleting.
:::

### Backup your controller
If you want to keep these networks, copy the ZeroTier Home directory somewhere. 
Most importantly, the identity.secret and the controller.d directory.

### Clean up networks
You may want to delete these networks now that you're done testing. 
You could use the API to delete every network. 

Or you can delete the controller.d directory.
