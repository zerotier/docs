### Not receiving emails from us?

If you are not receiving password reset emails, first check your Spam/Junk Mail folder.

If it's not in your Spam/Junk Mail folder, contact your email administrator to ensure emails from my@zerotier.com are not being blocked at the server level.

### Changing Your Email Address

Log into ZeroTier Central at https://my.zerotier.com. Once logged in, there's a "Manage Account" link on the Account page.  Click that and then "Personal Info" and you'll be taken to a form where you can change your email address.

### Invalid Authenticator Code

This can be caused by the time being wrong on your computer or phone.

### Lost Authenticator Code

Use the Password Reset flow. Click "forgot password" on the login screen.
