[Central](/central) is our hosted control plane for ZeroTierOne networks.

In addition to the web-based GUI, you can use the [Central API](/api/central/) to view and manage your networks. You will need an [API token](/api/tokens#zerotier-central-token) for access.

You can write your own client code to connect with Central using our [examples](/api/central/examples) as a starting point, or use an existing integration like our [Terraform provider](/terraform).
