The Network Rules Engine {#3thenetworkrulesengineaname3a}
-------------------------------

Traffic on ZeroTier networks can be observed and controlled with a
system of globally applied network rules. These are enforced in a
distributed fashion by both the senders and the receivers of packets. To
escape the rules engine a malicious attacker would need to fully
compromise both sides of any conversation.

The ZeroTier VL2 rules engine differs from most other firewalls and SDN
rules engines in several ways. The most immediately relevant of these is
that the ZeroTier rules engine is stateless, meaning it lacks connection
tracking. This means that bidirectional whitelisting can’t be
accomplished by simply whitelisting reply packets to established
connections. Instead some thought must be put into how to allow both
sides of a desired flow. Rule patterns to achieve the most common
desired objectives are included in this manual.

The decision to make our rules engine stateless was a design trade-off
driven by several concerns. First we wanted to keep complexity, code
footprint, and memory use very low to support small embedded devices.
The second and more fundamental reason is that distributed stateful
filtering requires distributed state synchronization. This would have
added a large volume of additional sync traffic as well as introducing
[inescapable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) new sources of
instability and failure and a lot of surface area for security
vulnerabilities.

While ZeroTier lacks state tracking, its rules engine includes something
not found anywhere else in the enterprise networking space:
[capability-based
security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) and
device tagging. Capabilities and tags allow extremely complex
micro-segmented network rule schemes to be implemented in a sane,
conceptual way that is both easier for human beings to understand and
more efficient for machines to handle.

This section assumes some level of familiarity with network rules as
they’re commonly used on firewalls and routers, etc. While the rules
engine is part of VL2, it’s been given its own section in this manual
due to the depth and cross-cutting nature of the topic.

### Rule Sets and Rule Evaluation {#31rulesetsandruleevaluationaname3_1a}

Rule sets are ordered lists of one or more rules, with each rule
consisting of one or more **match** conditions followed by one
**action**. As a rule set is evaluated, each match is tested in order
and is then ANDed or ORed with the previous match result state. When an
action is encountered it is taken if the result of the preceding matches
is *true*. An action with no preceding matches is always taken. If no
permissive actions are taken by any rule set the packet is discarded.

Here is a simple rule set that constrains Ethernet traffic on a network
to only IPv4, ARP, or IPv6 as it would appear in the raw JSON format
used by ZeroTier One’s built-in network controller implementation.
(Don’t worry if this seems verbose and difficult. We have a more
human-friendly way of writing rule sets, but before we introduce it it’s
important to understand what is really happening.)

```json
[
  {
    "etherType": 2048,
    "not": true,
    "or": false,
    "type": "MATCH_ETHERTYPE"
  },
  {
    "etherType": 2054,
    "not": true,
    "or": false,
    "type": "MATCH_ETHERTYPE"
  },
  {
    "etherType": 34525,
    "not": true,
    "or": false,
    "type": "MATCH_ETHERTYPE"
  },
  {
    "type": "ACTION_DROP"
  },
  {
    "type": "ACTION_ACCEPT"
  }
]
```

This checks whether an Ethernet level packet is *not* IPv4 (ethertype
2048) *and not* IPv4 ARP (ethertype 2054) *and not* IPv6 (ethertype
34525). If all three matches evaluate to true (meaning the ethertype is
none of these) then the **drop** action is taken. Otherwise the
**accept** action is taken.

Networks have one base rule set that is applied to all traffic. Its size
is constrained to 1024 entries (each match or action is an entry). It
should be used to set the overall policies for all members of the
network, and for most common use cases it’s all you’ll need. For more
complex scenarios, both capabilities and tags provide methods of both
managing complexity and scaling the overall size of a network’s rule
system.

### Actions and Match Conditions {#311actionsandmatchconditionsaname3_1_1a}

These are the available matches and actions in raw form. The rule
definition language outlined in [section
3.4](https://www.zerotier.com/manual.shtml#3_4) provides a friendlier
way for human beings to specify rules.


| Action | Argument(s) | Description |
| :---| :--- | :--- |
| ACTION\_DROP | | Drop packet and terminate all rule evaluation, including capabilities. |
| ACTION\_BREAK | |  Terminate evaluation of this rule set but continue evaluating capabilities. |
| ACTION\_ACCEPT | | Accept packet and terminate further evaluation. |
| ACTION\_TEE | length,address | Send a copy of up to the first *length* bytes (-1 for all) to a ZeroTier address. |
| ACTION\_REDIRECT | address | Transparently redirect this packet to a ZeroTier address without changing its headers. |
| **Match Condition** | **Argument(s)** | **Description** |
| MATCH\_SOURCE\_ZEROTIER\_ADDRESS | zt | VL1 source address. |
| MATCH\_DEST\_ZEROTIER\_ADDRESS | zt | VL1 destination address. |
| MATCH\_MAC\_SOURCE | mac | Ethernet source address. |
| MATCH\_MAC\_DEST | mac | Ethernet destination address. |
| MATCH\_IPV4\_SOURCE | ip | IPv4 source address. |
| MATCH\_IPV4\_DEST | ip | IPv4 destination address. |
| MATCH\_IPV6\_SOURCE | ip | IPv6 source address. |
| MATCH\_IPV6\_DEST | ip | IPv6 destination address. |
| MATCH\_IP\_TOS | mask,start,end | IP TOS field bitwise-ANDed with mask is within range. |
| MATCH\_IP\_PROTOCOL | ipProtocol | IP protocol number. |
| MATCH\_ETHERTYPE | etherType | Ethernet frame type. |
| MATCH\_ICMP | icmpType,icmpCode | ICMP type and code, if applicable. (V4 or V6) |
| MATCH\_IP\_SOURCE\_PORT\_RANGE | start,end | IP (V4 or V6) source port range (inclusive). |
| MATCH\_IP\_DEST\_PORT\_RANGE | start,end | IP (V4 or V6) destination port range (inclusive). |
| MATCH\_CHARACTERISTICS | mask | Bitwise AND characteristic bits with mask, true if result is nonzero. |
| MATCH\_FRAME\_SIZE\_RANGE | start,end | Ethernet frame size range (inclusive). |
| MATCH\_RANDOM | probability | Match if a random 32-bit number is less than or equal to the probability. |
| MATCH\_TAGS\_DIFFERENCE | id,value | Difference between tags with this ID is less than or equal to the value. |
| MATCH\_TAGS\_BITWISE\_AND | id,value | Tags ANDed together equal value. |
| MATCH\_TAGS\_BITWISE\_OR | id,value | Tags ORed together equal value. |
| MATCH\_TAGS\_BITWISE\_XOR | id,value | Tags XORed together equal value. |
| MATCH\_TAGS\_EQUAL | id,value | Both tags equal the same value. |
| MATCH\_TAG\_SENDER | id,value | Sending side’s tag equals this value. |
| MATCH\_TAG\_RECEIVER | id,value | Receiving side’s tag equals this value. |

### Capabilities {#32capabilitiesaname3_2a}

A capability is a small rule set that is bundled into a credential
object, signed by the network controller, and issued to only those
member(s) permitted to exercise it. When a member detects that outgoing
traffic does not match the base rule set but is allowed by one of its
capabilities, it periodically pushes the matching capability credential
to the recipient ahead of the packet(s) in question. Peer to peer
capability distribution is automatic and is triggered by capability
match.

When the recipient receives the capability it authenticates it by
checking its signature and timestamp and, provided the capability is
valid, adds it to the set of capabilities to apply to incoming traffic
from the capability’s owner. The sender has effectively told the
recipient “I can too send this packet! Teacher says so!”

Capabilities allow large systems of rules to be broken down into
functional aspects and then distributed intelligently only to those
members with a need to know. This avoids the bandwidth and storage
overhead of distributing huge monolithic rule sets and organizes rules
conceptually to make them easier for administrators to understand.

There are three terminating actions that can be taken in a rule set:
**accept**, **break**, and **drop**. The accept action terminates rule
evaluation and accepts the packet. The break action terminates the
evaluation of the current rule set but permits the further evaluation of
capabilities. The drop action terminates rule evaluation and drops the
packet without checking capabilities in the base rule set, but is
equivalent to break in capability rule sets. In most cases break should
be used unless certain traffic must be absolutely prohibited under any
circumstance.

In the simple base rule set example in section 3.1 the drop action is
taken in the unapproved case. This means that Ethernet whitelisting
cannot be overridden by a capability. If we change `ACTION_DROP` in our
example to `ACTION_BREAK`, then it becomes possible to issue the
following capability:

```json
[
  {
    "etherType": 2114,
    "not": false,
    "or": false,
    "type": "MATCH_ETHERTYPE"
  },
  {
    "type": "ACTION_ACCEPT"
  }
]
```

Ethertype 2114 is [wake-on-LAN](https://wiki.wireshark.org/WakeOnLAN), a
special packet that can cause some systems to wake from sleep mode. If
we place the above tiny rule set into a capability and issue it to a
device, this device *but no others* will now be permitted to send
wake-on-LAN magic packets. (Wake-on-LAN requires hardware support so it
would only work to target devices plugged into a physical network
bridged to a ZeroTier network, but don’t worry about that here. It’s
just an example of special traffic.)

Capability rule sets are limited to only 64 entries. The idea is to keep
them small and simple. A capability should grant one thing or one small
set of conceptually related things.

### Tags {#33tagsaname3_3a}

ZeroTier provides a second mechanism to control rule set complexity.
Tags are 32-bit numeric key-value pair credentials that are issued to
network members and signed by the controller. They are then distributed
peer to peer on a need to know basis in a similar manner to
capabilities.

Tags provide a way to conditionally drop or allow traffic between
members by member classification. They allow very detailed network
micro-segmentation by member role, permission, function, etc. without
resulting in a combinatorial explosion in rules table size.

Let’s say we want to permit traffic on TCP ports 139 and 445
(netbios/CIFS file sharing) only between systems that belong to the same
department. Our company has 12,000 devices and 10 departments. Without
tags this would require 144,000,000 rules, but with tags it can be
accomplished by only a few.

First a tag is created to represent the department. Let’s give it tag ID
100. Each member system receives the tag with a value from 1 to 10
indicating which department it belongs to. We can then add the following
rules to our network’s base rule set (or to a capability if so desired):

```json
[
  {
    "type": "MATCH_IP_DEST_PORT_RANGE",
    "not": false,
    "or": false,
    "start": 139,
    "end": 139
  },
  {
    "type": "MATCH_IP_DEST_PORT_RANGE",
    "not": false,
    "or": true,
    "start": 445,
    "end": 445
  },
  {
    "type": "MATCH_IP_PROTOCOL",
    "not": false,
    "or": false,
    "ipProtocol": 6
  },
  {
    "type": "MATCH_TAGS_DIFFERENCE",
    "not": false,
    "or": false,
    "id": 100,
    "value": 0
  },
  {
    "type": "ACTION_ACCEPT"
  }
]
```

This tells members in our network to accept TCP packets on ports 139 or
445 if the difference between tags with tag ID 10 is zero, meaning they
match. (If a member does not have a value for this tag, it does not
match.) Now all members of the same department can access CIFS file
shares, but CIFS sharing between departments could still be prohibited.
(TCP whitelisting requires some additional rules due to the stateless
nature of our rules engine. See the section below on rule design
patterns.)

Tags can be compared on numeric value or as bit fields via several
different bit mask operations allowing many different systems of member
classification to be implemented.

### Rule Definition Language {#34ruledefinitionlanguageaname3_4a}

Raw rule sets are verbose and difficult to write, so we created a
minimal rule definition language that’s easier for human beings.

The parser for this language can be found in the [rule-compiler
subfolder of the ZeroTierOne
project](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/tree/master/rule-compiler)
and as
[zerotier-rule-compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zerotier-rule-compiler)
on NPM. It’s written in JavaScript and is the same code that powers the
in-browser editor in ZeroTier Central.

### An Introductory Example {#341anintroductoryexampleaname3_4_1a}

```text
# Whitelist only IPv4 (/ARP) and IPv6 traffic and allow only ZeroTier-assigned IP addresses
drop                      # drop cannot be overridden by capabilities
  not ethertype ipv4      # frame is not ipv4
  and not ethertype arp   # AND is not ARP
  and not ethertype ipv6  # AND is not ipv6
  or not chr ipauth       # OR IP addresses are not authenticated (1.2.0+ only!)
;

# Allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS by allowing all TCP packets (including SYN/!ACK) to these ports
accept
  dport 22 or dport 80 or dport 443
  and ipprotocol tcp
;

# Create a tag for which department someone is in
tag department
  id 1000                 # arbitrary, but must be unique
  enum 100 sales          # has no meaning to filter, but used in UI to offer a selection
  enum 200 engineering
  enum 300 support
  enum 400 manufacturing
;

# Allow Windows CIFS and netbios between computers in the same department using a tag
accept
  dport 139 or dport 445
  and ipprotocol tcp
  and tdiff department 0  # difference between department tags is 0, meaning they match
;

# Drop TCP SYN,!ACK packets (new connections) not explicitly whitelisted above
break                     # break can be overridden by a capability
  chr tcp_syn             # TCP SYN (TCP flags will never match non-TCP packets)
  and not chr tcp_ack     # AND not TCP ACK
;

# Create a capability called "superuser" that lets its holders override all but the initial "drop"
cap superuser
  id 1000 # arbitrary, but must be unique
  accept; # allow with no match conditions means allow anything and everything
;

# Accept other packets
accept;
```

This creates a network that can pass IPv4 (and ARP) and IPv6 traffic but
no other Ethernet frame types. In addition the `not chr ipauth`
condition drops traffic between IP addresses that have not been assigned
by ZeroTier to their respective sources or destinations, blocking all IP
spoofing. These are enforced with a hard `drop`, preventing them from
being overridden by any capability.

All UDP is allowed, but all non-whitelisted new TCP connections
(SYN/!ACK packets) are blocked. This is done with a soft `break`,
allowing it to be overridden by capabilities. New TCP connections are
allowed on ports 22, 80, and 443 for everyone. Windows file sharing is
allowed only between computers in the same department by way of a tag. A
super-user capability that can be assigned to administrative nodes
allows the sender to initiate any kind of connection.

See [section 3.5.1](https://www.zerotier.com/manual.shtml#3_5_1) for a
discussion of how we accomplish TCP whitelisting here.

### Rule Definition Language Syntax {#342ruledefinitionlanguagesyntaxaname3_4_2a}

```text
# The remainder of this line is a comment.

action [ ... args ... ]
  [and|or] [not] match [... args ...]
  [ ... additional matches ... ]
;

tag <name>
  id <id>                 # arbitrary unique 32-bit ID
  [default <value>]       # default tag value to assign to members
  [enum <value> <name>]   # value can be any 32-bit unsigned integer
  [flag <bit> <name>]     # bit can be 0 to 31
  [ ... additional enums or flags ... ]
;

cap <name>
  id <id>                 # arbitrary unique 32-bit ID
  action [ ... args ... ]
    [ ... ]
  ;
  [ ... additional action blocks ... ]
;

macro <name[($var1,...)]>
  action [ ... args ... ]
    [ ... ]
  ;
;

include <name(value,...)>
```

Each action, tag, capability, or macro block ends with a semicolon.
White space separates things. Indentation is not significant. Hash
symbols indicate that the remainder of a line is a comment.

As described in sections
[3.1](https://www.zerotier.com/manual.shtml#3_1) through
[3.3](https://www.zerotier.com/manual.shtml#3_3), a rule set is composed
of one or more sequences of *match,[match],…,action* in which the action
is taken if the chain of matches evaluates to *true*. Capabilities are
small bundles of rules that can be assigned to nodes to give them
special abilities, and tags are key/value pairs that can be assigned to
nodes to allow rules to be selectively applied.

Macros are just a convenient way of defining more complex actions that
can then be applied in multiple places. An example of a macro might be:

```text
macro allowtcp($port)
  accept
    ipprotocol tcp
    and dport $port
  ;
;
```

You could then allow TCP ports in a standard TCP whitelisting scheme by
just saying:

```text
include allowtcp(80)
include allowtcp(443)
include allowtcp(8080)
```

Tag `enum` and `flag` directives have no meaning to the actual ZeroTier
rules engine, but they can be used by user interfaces like ZeroTier
Central to make it easier to assign and search tags.

### Actions, Matches, Operators, and Constants {#343actionsmatchesoperatorsandconstantsaname3_4_3a}

| Action | Argument(s) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| drop | | Drop packet and terminate all rule evaluation, including capabilities. |
| break | | Terminate evaluation of this rule set but continue evaluating capabilities. |
| accept | | Accept packet and terminate further evaluation. |
| tee | <length\> <address\> | Send a copy of up to the first *length* bytes (-1 for all) to a ZeroTier address. |
| redirect | <address\> | Transparently redirect this packet to a ZeroTier address without changing its headers. |
| **Match Condition** | **Argument(s)** | **Description** |
| ztsrc  | <address\> | VL1 source address. |
| ztdest | <address\> | VL1 destination address. |
| macsrc | <address\> | Ethernet source address. |
| macdest | <address\> | Ethernet destination address. |
| ipsrc | <address/prefix\> | Source IP address or network (V4 or V6 auto-detected). |
| ipdest | <address/prefix\> | Destination IP address or network (V4 or V6 auto-detected). |
| iptos | <mask\> <start[-end]\> | IP TOS field bitwise-ANDed with mask is within range. |
| ipprotocol | <protocol\> | IP protocol number. |
| ethertype | <type\> | Ethernet frame type. |
| icmp | <type\> <code\> | ICMP type (V4 or V6) and code. Use -1 for code if not applicable. |
| sport | <start[-end]\> | IP (V4 or V6) source port range (inclusive). |
| dport | <start[-end]\> | IP (V4 or V6) destination port range (inclusive). |
| chr | <mask/name\> | Bitwise AND characteristic bits with mask, true if result is nonzero. |
| framesize | <start[-end]\> | Ethernet frame size range (inclusive). |
| random | <probability\> | Match randomly with probability 0.0 (0%) to 1.0 (100%). |
| tdiff | <id\> <value\> | Difference between tags (absolute value) with this ID is less than or equal to the value. |
| tand | <id\> <value\> | Tags ANDed together equal value. |
| tor | <id\> <value\> | Tags ORed together equal value. |
| txor | <id\> <value\> | Tags XORed together equal value. |

| tseq | <id\> <value\> | Sending side’s tag equals this value. |
| treq | <id\> <value\> | Receiving side’s tag equals this value. |

Match conditions may be joined by **and** (default if none specified) or
**or** and may be modified by **not**.

Match conditions are evaluated from left to right; `a and b or c` is a different rule than `b or c and a`.
The rules language doesn't support parentheses, but for example purposes the above would evaluate as: `(a and b) or c` vs `(b or c) and a`

Traffic won't be `tee`d if it is blocked by a `break` or `drop`.

For convenience the following symbols can be used when matching on
certain packet attributes:

-   IP protocols (`ipprotocol`): **icmp** (for IPv4), **igmp**, **ipip**, **tcp**,
    **egp**, **igp**, **udp**, **rdp**, **esp**, **ah**, **icmp6** (for
    IPv6), **l2tp**, **sctp**, and **udplite**. 
-   Ethernet frame types (`ethertype`): **ipv4**, **arp**, **ipv6**, **wol** (wake on
    LAN), **rarp**, **atalk**, **aarp**, **ipx_a**, **ipx_b**. 

-   Packet characteristics (bit masks for `chr`):
    -   **inbound**: packet is being filtered on the receiving side (use
        `not inbound` for sending side)
    -   **multicast**: destination is a multicast or broadcast MAC
    -   **broadcast**: destination is the broadcast MAC
    -   **ipauth**: sender IP is assigned by ZeroTier to the sending
        node
    -   **tcp\_fin**: packet is TCP with FIN flag set
    -   **tcp\_syn**: packet is TCP with SYN flag set
    -   **tcp\_rst**: packet is TCP with RST flag set
    -   **tcp\_psh**: packet is TCP with PSH flag set
    -   **tcp\_ack**: packet is TCP with ACK flag set
    -   **tcp\_urg**: packet is TCP with URG flag set
    -   **tcp\_ece**: packet is TCP with ECE flag set
    -   **tcp\_cwr**: packet is TCP with CWR flag set
    -   **tcp\_ns**: packet is TCP with NS flag set
    -   **tcp\_rs2**: packet is TCP with RS2 (reserved bit 2) flag set
    -   **tcp\_rs1**: packet is TCP with RS1 (reserved bit 1) flag set
    -   **tcp\_rs0**: packet is TCP with RS0 (reserved bit 0) flag set

### Useful Design Patterns {#35usefuldesignpatternsaname3_5a}

### TCP Whitelisting {#351tcpwhitelistinganame3_5_1a}

First, add this at or near the bottom of your rules:

    # Block TCP SYN,!ACK to prevent new non-whitelisted TCP connections from being initiated
    # unless previously whitelisted or allowed by a capability.
    break chr tcp_syn and not chr tcp_ack;

Then above the SYN,!ACK break (or in a capability) add rules to allow
TCP packets with permitted destination ports:

    # Allow TCP port 80 (HTTP)
    accept ipprotocol tcp and dport 80;

ZeroTier’s filter is stateless. If we block all TCP packets except those
with the correct destination port, this will prevent reply packets from
returning to their senders.

Allowing reply packets with the correct (inverse) source port seems like
a simple fix, but this is insecure as it allows anyone to initiate any
TCP connection if they bind to whitelisted source ports.

The best solution is to block all non-whitelisted TCP packets with flags
SYN,!ACK (SYN and not ACK) and and then whitelist desired destination
ports. This way TCP replies and control traffic are allowed, but new
connections cannot be opened unless they are permitted.

### Locking Down UDP {#352lockingdownudpaname3_5_2a}

UDP is tougher to deal with in a stateless paradigm. It’s connectionless
so there is no way to specifically select a new session vs. an existing
session. The best way to lock down UDP on a network is to use tags to
allow it to and from things like DNS servers that need to speak it.

```text
tag udpserver
  id 1000
  default 0
;

accept
  ipprotocol udp
  and tor udpserver 1
  or chr multicast
;

break ipprotocol udp;
```

First we define a tag called `udpserver` with a default value of 0. We
don’t set any enums or flags for this tag since it will be used as a
boolean. For servers that need to respond to DNS queries, set the
`udpserver` to `1`.

Then we accept UDP traffic if the value of the `udpserver` tag is `1`
when both sender and receiver tags are ORed together, or if UDP traffic
is multicast. This allows multicast mDNS and Netbios announcements and
allows UDP traffic to and from UDP servers, but prohibits other
horizontal UDP traffic.

### Traffic Observation and Interception {#353trafficobservationandinterceptionaname3_5_3a}

Here’s a simple rule to monitor everything:

    # Send a copy of EVERY packet on both sender and receiver side to ZeroTier address "deadbeef11".
    tee -1 deadbeef11;

That’s going to flood `deadbeef11` with two full copies of every single
packet, since it will match on both the sender and the recipient side. A
less bandwidth-intensive security monitor setup might look like this:

    tee 128 deadbeef11
      chr inbound
      and chr tcp_syn or chr tcp_rst or chr tcp_fin
      or random 0.1
    ;

    tee 128 deadbeef22
      not chr inbound
      and chr tcp_syn or chr tcp_rst or chr tcp_fin
      or random 0.1
    ;

This is a bit more clever. It sends the first 128 bytes of every TCP
SYN, RST, or FIN packet (TCP connection open and close) to one observer
on the inbound side and another observer on the outbound side. It also
sends the first 128 bytes of other packets with a probability of one in
ten. The first 128 bytes of a packet will be enough to see the Ethernet
and IP headers as well as layer 4+ information about many protocols.

This would allow observers to watch every new TCP connection on the
network and also passively monitor other traffic in a “fuzzy”
probabilistic fashion without using very much bandwidth. We split
sending and receiving observers to prevent duplicate packets and also to
allow us to detect cases where one side is failing to tee traffic more
frequently than would be easily explained by packet loss.

There are many, many variations on the above that are possible but
hopefully these will be enough to get you started.

Passive out-of-line monitoring with **tee** is not perfect. If bandwidth
between two parties exceeds the bandwidth of one or both parties to the
observer, packets will get dropped. It also provides no mechanism to
filter traffic in depth since the observer cannot directly intervene
(though it could de-authorize a member via the controller API).

Active in-line monitoring can be achieved with **redirect**:

    redirect deadbeef11
      dport 80 or sport 80
      and ipprotocol tcp
    ;

This will pipe all HTTP traffic through `deadbeef11`. The target node
will receive each Ethernet frame intact including its original Ethernet
source and destination MAC address. To forward the packet on to its
final destination, simply re-send it unmodified via the same interface
on which it was received. The intermediate node could scan, modify, and
interrupt HTTP traffic across the network. To regular network
participants this is completely invisible as it occurs at layer 2
(Ethernet), though some performance degradation may be noticed
especially if the link is running across WAN.

### The Classified System Pattern {#354theclassifiedsystempatternaname3_5_4a}

One useful pattern for access control resembles the way military
organizations classify data. Information is deemed classified, and only
those who have the required level of classification are allowed to
access it.

A model resembling this can be implemented in ZeroTier network rules as
follows:

    # Is this member classified?
    tag classified
      id 2
      enum 0 no
      enum 1 secret
      enum 2 top
      default no
    ;

    # Clearance flags (a bit like groups)
    tag clearance
      id 1
      default 0
      flag 0 staging
      flag 1 production
      flag 2 financial
      flag 3 security
      flag 4 executive
    ;

    # If one party is classified, require at least one overlapping clearance bit
    break
      not tor classified 0
      and tand clearance 0
    ;

Initially members will be assigned a default classification of 0 (“no”).
These can freely communicate since the bitwise OR of their *classified*
tags will be zero. Neither member possesses a classification
requirement.

To restrict access to a member, set its *classified* tag to *secret* or
*top*. (In this example there is no difference, but two levels are
included in case you want to implement some kind of more detailed
segmentation based on these.) Now the first match
(`not tor classified 0`) will be true and the packet will be dropped
unless the two communicating members have at least once *clearance* bit
in common (`tand clearance 0`).
