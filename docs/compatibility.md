ZeroTier can run on Linux, macOS, iOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Android, and Windows. It is designed to operate in under 16 megabytes of memory in most cases. It can run on Intel x86, x64, ARM, and MIPS chips. If there is a device you'd like us to support [please let us know.](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne)

We generally adhere to manufacturer life-cycles for feature support of each platform but will attempt to backport important security updates to versions for older operating systems where possible.

## Recommended hardware

ZeroTier runs on just about anything but there are devices we've used and found especially useful or performant:
