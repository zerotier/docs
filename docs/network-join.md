Joining happens from a device, after installing ZeroTier One. You can join your own networks and other people's networks.

### macOS and Windows

On macOS and Windows, find the ZeroTier app in your menu bar. Launch the ZeroTier One app bundle if it's not already running. Click the ‚èÅ icon on your menu bar and select 'Join New Network'.

Type or paste in your network ID and hit 'Join Network'

### From the Command Line

From the command line simply type zerotier-cli join ################ with ############### being the 16-digit network ID of the network you wish to join.

On UNIX based OSes, this requires sudo. On Windows, this requires an administrator command prompt.
